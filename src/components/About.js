      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 24-year-old robotics enthusiast, driven by a lifelong dream of
        creating humanoid robots and enhancing human capabilities through
        technology. Inspired by Iron Man, I devoted my high school years to
        intensive studies in informatics and electronics, channeling my
        curiosity and motivation into building various projects such as robotic
        arms, boats, cars, airplanes, and gadgets of all type. My dedication led
        me to participate in the national stage of the FIRST Tech Challenge in
        Bucharest two times, earning the prize for Best Engineers.

        After high school, I pursued my passion at the University of Essex in
        the United Kingdom, where I delved into artificial intelligence,
        electronics, genetic programming, control theory, and more. Alongside my
        studies, I worked as a front-end freelancer on diverse projects
        including mobile apps, CRM and ERP systems, risk management application,
        web scraping, brochures, catalogues, 3D modeling, marketing, and event
        organization.
      </p>

        I graduated as a Robotic Engineer, successfully completing a capstone
        project that involved developing a data glove to control a 3D rigged
        hand model in Unity. Now, I am eager to find a role where I can combine
        my passion for robotics with my technical skills to solve real-world
        problems and drive innovation.
